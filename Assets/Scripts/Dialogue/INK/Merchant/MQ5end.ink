You've brought all the necessary materials. God bless you.

This should be plenty enough. I will get to work immediately on developing more upgrades for your weapons, then.

You're always free to upgrade your abilities further at the armory.

And, of course, your reward. You've greatly deserved it.

Thank you, Pilgrim. May God bless you.
